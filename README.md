# PMR robust design

A code to compute robust proportional-multiple-resonant (PMR) and current feedback controller to ensure uninterruptible power supply (UPS) stability and performance. PMR and current gain tuned by means of regional pole placement with LMI. Although inverter switching effects are not considered, output plotted without graphical environment facilitates learning and brief analysis of the resulting controller.
